## 1.6 (unreleased)

IMPROVEMENTS:
* **`:GoDef`** uses now `guru definition` under the hood instead of `godef`.
  This fixes the following issues: 1. dot imports 2. vendor imports 3. folder
  != package name imports

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

* `:GoDef` doesn't accept any identifier as an argument. This is not suported
  via `guru definition` and also was not widely used either. Also with this, we
  significantly simplified the existing def.vim code
